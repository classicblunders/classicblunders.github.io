The Slug’n Hurl is looking to replace a “slug”.  Since Prince “Big Mac” Fielder decided to take a “vacation” this year, I am in need of a fulltime 1B.  Most notable available for trade:
                                        
- Josh Harrison
- Neil Walker
- Adrian Beltre
- Junior Lake
- Leonys Martin
- Nick Castellenos
- Pick 1.12

Don’t need a 1B on the backside of a career.  Just someone who is equal in value to whomever is selected from the list above.
