Updating my OTB. Even though I stated my intentions below, all offers are welcome, any players and definitely early draft picks.

All player names are linked to their Baseball-Reference.com splits page.

##Pitching

- **[Clayton Kershaw](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=kershcl01&year=&t=p) and [Jonny Cueto](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=cuetojo01&year=&t=p):** The roster has pretty good depth at SP. I'm interested in exploring trades for the NL CY Young #1 and #2. I have some offensive holes and the roster is probably better off moving one of these two guys to improve it. I'm open to moving both and building towards the future.
- **[Mat Latos](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=latosma01&year=&t=p), [Rick Porcello](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=porceri01&year=&t=p), [Jake Odorizzi](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=odorija01&year=&t=p):** I'll probably move one of these SPs. 
- **[Dan Haren](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=harenda01&year=&t=p):** Thanks to the SP depth, he's the odd one out and he will find a new home this off season. Make me a quality draft pick offer and he's probably yours.

##Offense

- **[Robinson Cano](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=canoro01&year=&t=b):** I'll eventually need a 2B if I move him.
- **[Evan Longoria](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=longoev01&year=&t=b):** I need a SS; and I'll eventually need a 3B if I move him.
