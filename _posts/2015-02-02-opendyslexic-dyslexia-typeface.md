I'm always on the lookout for new typefaces (<a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface">not to be confused with font</a>) to add to <a href="http://www.classicblunders.com/fountainhead">Fountainhead</a> as well as for my own personal use.
</p>

<p>
One typeface that I recently came across is <a href="http://opendyslexic.org">OpenDyslexic</a>, a typeface created to increase readability for those which dyslexia (btw, this post is displayed in OpenDyslexic). While I doubt it will help everyone with dyslexia, I've asked a few dyslexic friends to try it out, and they said it made reading a little easier. 
</p>

<p>
For my own projects, I use <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-code-pro">Source Code Pro</a> (which I first encountered when using Adobe's text editor, <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>). Brackets is great when dealing with web design, but I still find <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> the best overall text editor (especially since I can add to its functionality using Python).
</p>

<p>
Got a typeface that you think is better than Source Code Pro or OpenDyslexic? Let me know and I'll try it out (unless it costs a <a href="http://www.typewolf.com/blog/the-worlds-most-expensive-typeface">king's ransom</a>).
