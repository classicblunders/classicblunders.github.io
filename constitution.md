#OVERVIEW

The ADML consists of 24 franchises. These franchises utilize the Diamond Mind computer game to play a pre-determined schedule of assigned games. The results of these games are reported to the league statistician as well as the opposing franchise manager each month on a timely basis. The results are then compiled on a monthly basis and distributed to each franchise.

#REQUIREMENTS

Each member of the ADML MUST own the Diamond Mind Baseball computer game (latest version) as well as the Diamond Mind Baseball player disk that the season is based upon.

#LEAGUE PHILOSOPHY

The ADML exists for the enjoyment and sportsmanship of its members. It is intended to supply an outlet for fellowship, fairness, and competitiveness. It is a non-profit organization whose dues and monies (when applied) are used to cover expenses incurred in the operation of the league.

#DUES

The annual dues are presently are waived. This money will be used for purchase/mailing of awards. The commissioner and/or the league committee may reinitiate dues as needed.

#ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

The ADML consists of 24 members, with each member having responsibility for the prompt and conscientious management of the obligations of their franchise. The ADML is governed by a Commissioner who is assisted by the ADML League  Committee. The ADML League Committee consists of 6 league members.  The Commissioner will be a voting member of the League Committee only to break ties.

In any vote taken by the League Committee, a simple majority vote will determine the outcome.

The Commissioner has complete and final authority.

#LEAGUE STRUCTURE

The 24 franchises are divided into 2 conferences. Each conference consists of 12 franchises, divided into 2 divisions.

#FRANCHISES

Each franchise maintains a roster of players, utilizing these players to instruct other franchises in the playing of all away series as well as utilizing them in the playing of all home series. Each home franchise reports the statistical results of these series to the league statistician as well as the visiting franchise.

#SCHEDULE

Regular season play will begin April 1st and end September 20. Each team will play 158 games.

The Diamond Mind Computer Manager will be used for visiting teams. The manager profile for visiting teams must reach the home team manager by the 1st of each month.

All home games must be played and reported to both the statistician and all visiting managers by the 20th of each month.

#ROSTERS

Team rosters will have 35 players. No more than 3 players on a team's roster may be unrated by DMB. Teams rosters must have sufficient batting and pitching resources to cover the 158 game schedule. Sufficient resources would be 158 starts, approximately 700 plate appearances per position, and approximately 300 relief appearances.

Of the players on a team's roster, 27 are designated as active for each series. The 27 players designated as active may differ from series to series.During September only, all players on a team's roster (except for unrated players) may be designated as active.

One week after the DMB disk is available of each year all teams must cut to 25 players. The players released via this cut will be available in the next rookie draft.

Final roster cuts to 35 players must be submitted to the commissioner by midnight (EST), March 15th. Failure to do so will results in the commissioner making the cuts for you and a late penalty being assessed to your team.

For one week (March 16-22), each team may make one drop-add move. They may drop one player from their roster, and add one player from the  available player pool. This will be on a first come, first served basis. If for any reason a team does not have 35 players on their rosters as of March 16th, the Commissioner will randomly assign a DMB free agent player to complete the roster.

#PLAYER LIMITS

The DMB game will be used to manage maximum batting limits. Batters will be adjusted by the game to the value of replacement players after they have reached 110% of overall plate appearances, OR 166% on splits. Please see the in game help menu for more detail.

The number of ADML starts will be limited to their actual number of MLB starts times 1.1 up to a maximum of 34 starts. Players with more than 34 actual MLB starts will be limited to their actual number of MLB starts.

Relief pitchers and Starter/Relief pitchers will be limited to 110% of their batters faced.

All batters with at least 200 actual AB's must accumulate at least 50% of their actual PA total as ADML plate appearances or they will be released from their team and made available in the next rookie draft. The % meter in the game will be used.

#ROOKIE DRAFT

- Any player rated by Diamond Mind Baseball who is not already on an ADML roster is eligible to be selected in the ADML Rookie Draft.
- The team drafting order will be in reverse order of overall W-L record, with the exception of the eight playoff teams.
- These will occupy the final 8 positions in round 1, based on their playoff finish.
- In the case where there is a tie in W-L records we will alternate the teams in subsequent rounds with identical records.
- All ties are broken by, in order, worse home W-L record, head to head play (if applicable), or coin flip.

##Playoffs

At the conclusion of the regular season, the commissioner will announce the playoff matchups for the first round and send out a playoff database. The participants will then have 14 days to complete their series. If at that time the series is not complete, the commissioner or a designee will finish it. The commissioner or designee will use manager profiles from the participants if provided. If none are provided then the commissioner shall generate profiles. The same will hold true of the second round and the World Series - 14 days for each series from the time the database is sent to the participants.

- All playoff series will consist of 7 games.
- The DH is used for all Playoff games.
- 27 players are active on a team's Playoff roster.
  - These 27 must remain the same throughout the Playoffs.
- There will be one day of "rest" between games #2 and #3 and games #5 and #6.
- Injury setting is **NONE**.
- A player's fatigue rating **DOES NOT** carry over from series to series.

The Playoffs teams will consist of the two division winners and the 2 teams with the next best records.

The first round will be between the team with the best record and the team with the 4th best record. The other matchup will be the other division winner and the wild card team with the best record. The division winner will have the home field advantage in a 2-3-2 format.

The second round will be between divisional winners in each conference. The team with the highest seasonal winning percentage will have the home field advantage in a 2-3-2 format.

The World Series will be between conference winners. The team with the highest seasonal winning percentage will have the home field advantage in a 2-3-2 format.

Once the first two games of a playoff series is finished, that home manager will send the exported stat file in which those games were played to both his opponent and the league commissioner and statistician.

The manager for the next three games in the series will use that directory to continue the series.

When the next three games in the series are completed, that home manager will send the exported stat file in which those games were played to both his opponent and the league commissioner and league statistician. If games 6 and/or 7 are necessary, they will be played by the home manager in that directory.

Once a playoff series is completed, the home manager that played the final game is responsible for sending the directory to both his opponent and the league commissioner and league statistician.

If a playoff series is played face to face, only one file needs to be sent to the commissioner and statistician.

##PENALTIES

###Overuse:

At the conclusion of the regular season any player who is over 110% of pa or bf (starting pitchers will use GS as a measure), is considered fatigued and ineligible to participate in the playoffs. If a manager has too many ineligible players to field a team, that team will forfeit its games. 

Overuse of players will be dealt with on a case by case basis by the Commissioner and/or League Committee.

###Lateness:

Since late stat files affect the entire league, consistently late stat files to the commissioner will be penalized harshly.

Late profiles/series results to visiting managers: These will be dealt with on an individual basis by the Commissioner and/or League Committee.

###Penalty note:

All penalties for a team will be null and void if that manager quits or is dropped from the league.

##MISCELLANEOUS

Era setting for each season, AL or NL, will be determined by coin flip.

A player rated in the OF may play any OF position.

Other than the OF rule above, players may only play positions at which they are rated by DMB.

If a home manager does not have a profile from an opponent by the 1st of the month, he is free to auto-generate a profile for the visiting team and play the series.

In addition to their opponents, visiting managers should send, via email, a copy of their manager profiles to the league Commissioner. This will help resolve any disputes that may arise and also enable the Commissioner to forward the profile if needed.
